hi..
If you need to use this method first you all need to download some libraries
commons-compress
commons-long
commons-logging
commons-net
commons-vfs

after downloading this put the libraries into your files
then you can call the method ,
for compression:
comp.compress(source path,destination path,file type);
source path - the path the folder contain want to compress
destination path - the final place the folder need to contain after compression
file type - the compress file type (it must we zip or tar or jar or cpio )  

for decompression :
comp.decompress(source path,destination path,file type);
comp.compress(source path,destination path,file type);
source path - the path the compressed folder contain
destination path - the final place the folder need to contain after decompression
file type - the compress file type (it must we zip or tar or jar or cpio)  


note:you can compress or de compress for other than zip,jar,tar and cpio.
